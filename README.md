# Registrationshop

##This repository provides a way to visualize deformation fields. This was carried out as a course project for Medical Visualization at TU Delft. The original UI of registration shop is retained and we added our own specific visualization and the necessary transfer functions to deal with deformation fields.(The input for the deformation field has to be in .mhd format).

##Description and installation instructions for registration shop(the installation procedure remains the same)

Interactive registration tool for 3D medical datasets.

## Components
Written for the most part in Python. Uses PySide for the interface and uses VTK for the visualizations. Uses [vtkMultiVolRen](https://github.com/karlkrissian/vtkMultiVolRen) for rendering multiple datasets in one vtkRenderer. My fork can be found at [https://github.com/berendkleinhaneveld/vtkMultiVolRen](https://github.com/berendkleinhaneveld/vtkMultiVolRen). Because of issues with building that fork on Windows I've incorporated the code into a fork of VTK which can be found at [https://github.com/berendkleinhaneveld/VTK/tree/release](https://github.com/berendkleinhaneveld/VTK/tree/release). Besides multi-volume render capabilities there are also some other nice features planned to be added to VTK and Registrationshop real soon... But more on that later!

For deformable registration [elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl) is used. The rigid transformation that you can create with the rigid registration tools will serve as initial transformation for elastix. The parameters for elastix can be edited inside Registrationshop so you don't have fall back to editing raw parameter files!

## Installation
Instructions on how to build Registrationshop are now available [here](INSTRUCTIONS.md)! Let me know if you run into any troubles. Builds are not available yet.

## Supported platforms
